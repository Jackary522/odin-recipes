    <h2>Easy one pot meal!</h2>
    <p>
      Potatoes, bacon, onions, eggs, and shredded cheese make a hearty and
      delicious breakfast or brunch dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 russet potatoes, scrubbed, chopped into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels;
        reserve most of the bacon fat in skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onions until starting to soften,
        about 5 minutes. Add potatoes; toss to coat evenly in bacon fat. Pour in
        water and cover skillet with a large lid. Cook, checking occasionally,
        until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Add green onions, garlic,
        and paprika. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make 4 wells in the potato mixture using a wooden spoon, revealing the
        bottom of the skillet. Crack an egg into each well; season with salt and
        pepper. Sprinkle cooked bacon and Cheddar cheese over the entire
        skillet. Replace lid; cook until egg whites are set and yolks are still
        runny, about 5 minutes.
